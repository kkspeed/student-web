I'm fan of functional programming languages. I've tried some of them:
Common Lisp, Clojure, Racket, and finally, Haskell. I'm facinated by
the seemingly infinite possiblity of the whole new functional programming
world. Well, I'm still learning. But I hope I
could say <a href="http://www.haskellers.com/user/3109">

interested in other open source projects and I consider myself a
die-hard Linux user.
