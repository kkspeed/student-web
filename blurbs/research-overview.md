My current research interest is broadly focused on *mobile sensing*,
*computer vision* and *security*. I believe that the proliferation of
mobile devices is changing our lifestyle. I would like to enrich our
daily life by making the most out of mobile devices. Along with the
benefits is increasing risk of privacy leak. I thereforce also work on
solutions that could make mobile devices safer.
